/*vectors are an array or a list.
it is a list of int, double, bool, strings, anything that is needed. 
Example:
    1)
        vector<int. grades = {12, 15, 19, 16, 15, 20} 
        this is a list (vector) of integers, this notation is used to initialize the integers
    
    2)
        vector<double> location(2);
        the "(2)" means the size of vector is going to be 2 
        location[0] = 2.3;
        location[1] = 3.5;
        cin >> location[1];
    
    TO use vectors we need to 
    #include<vector>
    using namespace std;

    Basic operations
        push_back: adds an element to the end of the vector
        pop_back: removes an element from the end of the vector
        size: returns size of the vector
