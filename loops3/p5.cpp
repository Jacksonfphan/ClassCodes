/*Write a program that takes a all lower-case string and encrypts it
 using a simple Caesar cipher (shift each letter by a fixed number of positions).
  For example, a key of 3 and the sentence, “i like to wear z hats.” 
  When this sentence is encrypted using a key of 3, it becomes:
   "l olnh wr zhdu c kdwv."*/
